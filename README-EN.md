>
> For VS Code extension [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline). **Version 1.2.4** — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Deployment

**Manual Copy (Recommended)**

Copy the following directories/files to the **target project root**:

| Component | Path | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Rules & Hooks | `.clinerules/` | L1/L3 + hooks (required) |
| Skills | `.agents/skills/` | Skills activated on demand (required) |
| Memory Templates | `memory/` | Progress/Blockers/Decisions (required) |
| Spec/Design Templates | `specs/`, `design/` | L4 templates (required) |
| Harness Config | `harness.config.json` | L2 enablement record |
| Cline Settings | `cline-desktop-settings.json` | Import to Cline (hooks/rules/skills/workflows) |
| Speckit (optional) | `.specify/` | Spec-driven development toolkit |

**L2 Domain Rules (Enable on Demand)**

L2 files are in `.clinerules/l2/`, **not loaded by default**. Copy the appropriate file to `.clinerules/` root to enable:

| Project Type | Enable L2 |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Agent / DeepAgents | Copy `l2/02-deepagents-code-rule.md` → `.clinerules/` |
| PyTorch / Deep Learning | Copy `l2/03-pytorch-code-rule.md` → `.clinerules/` |
| Regular project | Do not enable L2 |

**Extension Workflows**

All 13 workflows (including 9 extension workflows) are deployed by default. AI auto-selects the right workflow based on your natural language description.

> **Note**: `-Extras` parameter is deprecated. Extension workflows are already included in the default `.clinerules/workflows/` deployment.

> **Windows Tip**: Cline Hooks only support `.ps1` (e.g., `PreToolUse.ps1`). Deploy/self-check scripts are also `.ps1`; run them in **PowerShell terminal** with `-File`; do not double-click `.ps1` (may open in Notepad).

After deployment:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\verify-harness.ps1
```

**Cline Setup**

1. Import hooks / rules / skills / workflows from `cline-desktop-settings.json` in Cline
2. Install and enable in **Cline MCP Settings** (Harness guides Agent **when to call** these tools via rules/workflow; MCP itself is not in this package):
   - `superpowers` — Design refinement, TDD (see `00-core.md` §1, §3.1)
   - `codebase-memory-mcp` — Drift scan, CI feedback (see MCP integration table below)

### 2. Daily Use

| Operation | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Describe Task** | Use natural language; Cline auto-selects the right workflow |
| **Say "Done"** | Triggers session-end: verify → update Memory → confirm |
| **Use Speckit** | Say "Use speckit workflow" to activate full spec→implement workflow |

### 3. Memory Bank Update

Harness uses `memory/` directory as the project's Memory Bank (inspired by Cline official Memory Bank):

| File | Purpose | Update Timing |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `memory/progress.md` | Session progress + blockers + next steps | Every Session |
| `memory/blockers.md` | Blockers log | When issues arise |
| `memory/decisions.md` | Architecture decisions (ADR format) | Every decision |
| `memory/architecture.md` | Current architecture snapshot | On architecture changes |

**Auto-update on Done**: Saying "Done" triggers `session-end.md`, which auto-executes Phase 1 verify + Phase 3 Memory write.

**Manual update**: You can also say "update memory bank" anytime to trigger a full documentation review.

### 4. Harness Self-Check

Run `verify-harness.ps1` after deployment to verify Harness package integrity:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\verify-harness.ps1
```

Checks include: L1/L2 core files, PowerShell syntax, Rule ID consistency, Hook regression tests.

**GitHub Actions CI**: When pushing to GitHub, `.github/workflows/harness-ci.yml` automatically runs the same verification on `windows-latest` to prevent bad code from being merged.

### 5. Select L2 Domain Rules

L2 files are stored in `.clinerules/l2/`, **not loaded by default**. Copy the appropriate file to `.clinerules/` root to enable:

| Your Project Feature | Enable L2 |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Agent / `create_deep_agent()` | Copy `l2/02-deepagents-code-rule.md` |
| PyTorch / `import torch` | Copy `l2/03-pytorch-code-rule.md` |
| Regular project | Do not enable L2 |

### 6. Choose Workflow (by Task Type)

> **Natural Language Routing**: You don't need to memorize commands, just describe your needs. AI will automatically determine the right workflow. See [natural-language-routing.md](.clinerules/workflows/natural-language-routing.md) for details.

| You Say | AI Auto-Routes To |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| "I want to build a project from scratch" | Project initiation → new-feature-workflow |
| "Project won't start" | Establish startup baseline → `baseline-startup.md` |
| "I want to add a feature" | Feature initiation assessment → risk assessment |
| "Context too long, switch to new window" | Generate handoff text → `context-handoff.md` |
| "Project is getting messier" | AI Debt Audit → `ai-debt-audit.md` |
| "It's broken, keeps failing" | Error Rescue → `error-rescue.md` |
| "Fix this bug" | bugfix-workflow |
| "Use speckit workflow" | Speckit sub-system |

| Task Type | Use |
| --------- | --- |
| New feature / API change / Multi-module | `new-feature-workflow` |
| Bug fix / Small change (< 100 lines) | `bugfix-workflow` |
| Project won't start | `baseline-startup` |
| Keeps failing with same error | `error-rescue` |
| PyTorch experiment | `dl-experiment-workflow` |
| Large feature from scratch | `speckit/` series (requires `.specify/extensions.yml` or say "Use speckit workflow") |

### 7. Verify Harness

Run `verify-harness.ps1` after deployment to verify Harness package integrity:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\verify-harness.ps1
```

Checks include: L1/L2 core files, PowerShell syntax, Rule ID consistency.

## MCP Integration

> MCP installed in **Cline MCP Settings**; Harness guides Agent **when to call** these tools via rules/workflow.

| MCP Server | Tool | Purpose | Integrated File | Dependency |
| ---------- | ---- | ------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| `superpowers` | `test-driven-development` etc. | Design refinement, TDD test implementation | `00-core.md` §1, §3.1 | Requires superpowers MCP |
| `codebase-memory-mcp` | `search_graph` | Millisecond-level code symbol search | drift-scan-workflow | Requires MCP install + index_repository |
| `codebase-memory-mcp` | `query_graph` | Cypher graph query | drift-scan-workflow | Requires MCP install + index_repository |
| `codebase-memory-mcp` | `get_architecture` | Architecture overview | drift-scan-workflow | Requires MCP install + index_repository |
| `codebase-memory-mcp` | `trace_path` | Call chain tracing | ci-feedback-workflow | Requires MCP install + index_repository |
| `codebase-memory-mcp` | `detect_changes` | Change impact analysis | session-end | Requires MCP install + index_repository |

> ⚠️ **External Dependency**: MCP tools require user installation and configuration. Harness plays the role of "guiding when to call" these tools. **Not installing MCP does not affect Harness core functionality** (Hooks interception, workflow docs, rule system).

After installing `codebase-memory-mcp`, say "Index this project" to use it.

## Hooks Reference

### PreToolUse (Pre-Write Interception)

> When PreToolUse detects fixable issues, it returns `FixSuggestion`; Cline auto-corrects **before** writing (e.g., add encoding declaration, format).

| Rule ID | Name | Action | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| SEC-READ-001 | BlockSensitiveFileRead | BLOCK | Block reading production env config, credentials, .pem, .key |
| SEC-READ-WARN-001 | WarnDotEnvRead | WARN | Warn when reading .env files (allowed but reminds user) |
| SEC-CODE-001 | NoHardcodedCredentials | BLOCK | Block hardcoded passwords/API Keys/Tokens |
| SEC-SQL-001 | NoSqlInjectionViaStringConcat | BLOCK | Block SQL string concatenation, use parameterized queries |
| MEM-BANK-001 | RequireMemoryBankHeader | BLOCK | Memory Bank files must have Markdown header |
| MEM-BANK-002 | BlockPartialMemoryUpdate | BLOCK | Memory Bank must use write_to_file, not replace_in_file |
| MEM-BANK-003 | ValidateMemoryBankFormat | BLOCK | Memory Bank format validation |
| GEN-001 | NoTestDataInProductionCode | ALERT | Block test/example data in production code |
| PT-YAGNI-001 | NoUnrequestedAbstractions | WARN | No unrequested abstractions (ponytail) |
| PT-DEP-001 | NoUnrequestedDependencies | WARN | No unrequested new dependencies (ponytail) |
| PT-BOILER-001 | NoUnrequestedBoilerplate | WARN | No unrequested boilerplate (ponytail) |
| PT-MINIMAL-001 | FileSizeGuardWarn | WARN | File >500 lines suggests splitting (ponytail) |
| PT-MINIMAL-002 | FileSizeGuardAlert | ALERT | File >800 lines strongly suggests splitting (ponytail) |
| PT-MINIMAL-003 | FileSizeGuardBlock | BLOCK | File >1000 lines must split (ponytail) |
| OPS-FMT-001 | RequireEncodingDeclaration | WARN | Python files should declare UTF-8 encoding |
| CODE-PY-001 | NoEmptyExcept | BLOCK | No empty except clauses (catches all exceptions including KeyboardInterrupt) |
| CODE-PY-002 | BroadExceptWarning | WARN | Broad except Exception: warning (valid but not recommended) |
| CODE-JS-001 | NoDebuggerStatement | BLOCK | No debugger statements |
| CODE-JS-002 | NoConsoleLogLeftover | WARN | No console.log leftovers in production code |
| DUP-001 | TooManyFunctionsInFile | WARN | Too many functions warning (Python >20, JS/TS >30) |

### PostToolUse (Post-Write Audit)

> When PostToolUse detects fixable issues, it returns `AutoFix`; Cline calls `write_to_file` to auto-correct.

| Rule ID | Name | Action | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| AUDIT-SEC-001 | DetectLeakedSecrets | ALERT | Detect sk-/ghp-/AKIA key leaks |
| AUDIT-CODE-001 | NoDebugLeftovers | WARN | Detect debugger/console.log/pdb leftovers |
| AUDIT-PY-002 | NoHardcodedPath | WARN | Detect hardcoded Windows paths |

## Speckit Sub-System

> A complete Spec-Driven Development workflow, suitable for large features defined from scratch.

**Activation Conditions** (either one):

1. Project root contains `.specify/extensions.yml`
2. User says "Use speckit workflow"

**Workflow**:

```
speckit-specify.md    → Create/update feature spec
speckit-clarify.md    → Clarify requirements (optional)
speckit-plan.md       → Generate implementation plan
speckit-tasks.md      → Break down tasks
speckit-implement.md  → Execute implementation
speckit-checklist.md  → Generate delivery checklist
speckit-converge.md   → Converge completion
```

**Difference from Main Workflow**:

- Main workflow: daily development (requirements already clear)
- Speckit: defining requirements from 0 to 1
- Speckit has its own memory path (`.specify/memory/`)

**Windows Environment**: Speckit Bash scripts (`.specify/scripts/bash/`) require **Git Bash** or **WSL**. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and verify `where bash` works. PowerShell extensions (e.g., agent-context) run directly.

**Manifest Path**: Workflow files are in `.clinerules/workflows/speckit/`. After updating Speckit files, run:

```powershell
powershell -File scripts_cline_harness/regenerate-manifest.ps1
```

---

## Customization

| Need | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| PreToolUse too strict | Edit `Enabled` field in corresponding rule in `hooks/PreToolUse.ps1` |
| PostToolUse too slow | Auto-skips if `ruff`/`eslint` not installed; recommend installing linter in project |
| Small bug fix | Use `bugfix-workflow`, no need for full new-feature flow |
| Add new rule | See `CONTRIBUTING-RULES.md` |
| View terminology | See `GLOSSARY.md` |
